  <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>We are accommodation providers who had enough!<br>
          Enough of guest doing whatever they feel like than move on to next hotel or hostel and doing the same with no consequences
          Enough of guests threatening to write a bad review if….
          Enough of guests who think the towel they received is a souvenir from their trip or that the decorative vase on the table would look great in their living room
          Enough of OTA’s, like Booking.com, Expedia, Hostelworld etc, charging us whatever commission they feel like and there is nothing we can do about it.
          Enough of OTA’s forcing us to offer the lowest price on their site. If i want to offer a promotion or better price for direct reservation it is my right!
          Enough of worship and sacrifices to the new god. Ratings
          Enough to OTA’s always taking guests sides in case of a conflict when it is US who pay them so they should be on our side no?
          Enough of Tripadvisor allowing anyone to post whatever they feel, no matter if they stayed at our ho(s)tel or not,
          and... Enough of hearing all our hoteliers friends in meetings/whatsapp chats/Facebook groups, agreeing to the above but do nothing but complain
          We, the accommodation providers, are probably the most important player in the travel industry and yet we have almost no power, not when facing our guests and certainly not when facing the OTA’s. Absurd don't you think?
          So we decided to do something about it!
          We have created Whos Your Guest, a platform that allows us to share information about our guests behaviour, positive or less positive. This platform will return us the power we lack when facing out guests. In the near future we will also introduce solutions to help us return the power when facing the OTA’s
          The time for small local solutions, like whatsapp groups, is over. A global solution is needed. With the world so connected, a guest stealing a towel in Sao Paulo today can check into a hotel in Cancun tomorrow and the only way we can prevent their behaviour from repeating is by being connected all of us. Success depends on our collective strength on us taking care of each other, no matter the size of our hotel or hostel. Together we are stronger!
          We invite you to be part of the biggest accommodation providers network in the America but more important, of the only site in the world that has our interests, the accommodation providers, as its main and only interest!
          For any further questions check our FAQS section or contact us.
          Let's create together the world as we would like it to be. Problem free.<br>
          UNO PARA TODOS Y TODOS PARA UNO / ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE
